# Bazalgette

The WordPress plugin you've all been waiting for! Mentioned during WordCamp Europe 2023, this is my plugin that will finally, "automagically" tidy up your WP Admin menu.

No hands needed.

Just activate and let it work its magic. And, if you have a ChatGPT API key, it can do even more.

Everything, for now, is in the `develop` branch, until the first release. Until then, the version will remain sub 1.0, which means you should proceed trying it with caution.
